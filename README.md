This is a NestJS-based backend project that connects to the Binance WebSocket API to stream real-time cryptocurrency market data. The service listens to multiple streams (e.g., ticker, depth, trades, kline) and transforms the data for use in a frontend application.

## Features

- **Real-time Market Data**: Connects to Binance WebSocket streams to get real-time data for ticker prices, order book depth, trades, and kline (candlestick) data.
- **Futures Market Data**: Connects to Binance futures WebSocket streams.
- **Transformation of Data**: Data received from Binance is transformed to a format suitable for the frontend.
- **WebSocket Connections**: Multiple WebSocket connections to Binance are managed in parallel.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses environment variables for configuration like WebSocket base URLs.
